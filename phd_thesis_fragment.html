\title{Breathing in the Anthropocene}
\maketitle

The universal always relies on the particular for expression, and while it was never obvious that it was going to be geology, the articulation of that thing we today know as the Anthropocene had to come from somewhere. But long before geologists started discussing a hypothetical strata in the earth’s crust that some argued could signify the becoming-geological actor of humanity, there was no shortage of warnings that the ecological thresholds sustaining human society were under threat\footnote{For a long list of climate change warnings global in scope dating back to the 1750s, see Bonneuil and Fressoz 2016, pp. 62–65}.

In the 1980s, Elmar Altvater warned that the “ecological borders facing capital in its push to widen its frontiers” would be reached if measures were not taken. While still “far away,” he nevertheless suggested in alarming language that we had to “create social and political border lines before the frontier of capitalist expansion reaches the last ecological border, which would be fatal to the conditions of survival for the human race” (Altvater 1989, pp. 69–70). Had these insights been taken to a conceptual level, a radical critique of the logic of capital accumulation would perhaps have been part of the ideological wrapping surrounding whatever Anthropocene like term could have been created.

One may of course oppose that it was precisely the non-political nature of the Anthropocene which cleared the way for its hegemony, and that any term based in a Marxian critique of capital would have struggled to find an equally broad audience. At any rate, it just so happened that it was geology which stood ready with a term that—once detached from its immediate application in stratigraphy— could become the expression of the widely felt out-of-jointness between human civilization and the rest of nature. But since the universal is not merely expressed by the particular, but dialectically entangled with it, the Anthropocene did not become a neutral term depicting an objective reality. Instead, it came with an ideological wrapping of its own.

“The task facing us now,” writes Lauren Rickards, “is to consider what sort of world it will be if humans as geological force has sedimented into our thinking, a dead metaphor no longer recognized as such” (2015, p. 286). While we are by now so used to it that it may not strike us as a metaphor at all, to say that humanity is a “geological force” or, similarly, a “species” that can somehow act on the planet is in fact to propose a metahistorical category.

The last time an equally grand claim was made based on the “discovery” of a metahistorical category with an equally large impact on intellectual and political debate, Marx and Engels in The Communist Manifesto wrote that “the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle.” This infamous political pamphlet argued that the bourgeois epoch was synchronizing the world population into two classes: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The class nature of society could thus finally come into view. It was only in this epoch, they held, that the class nature of historical development could be made evident through industrial capitalism’s distributing of humans into two clearly defined classes. Having discovered class as a category, they could then project it back onto history and claim that class struggle was what had been happening all along, as well as into the future, where class difference would be dissolved once and for all.

Where Marx and Engels employed Hegelian dialectics to dig into history and uncover class, key Anthropocene thinkers used geological stratigraphy to drill through earth’s crust and discover a species. Where historical stages told a story of humanity dividing into two classes, geological strata spoke of humans uniting into one force.

Interestingly, both notions relied on spectral others to come into view. Where the Manifesto opened with the specter of Communism haunting Europe, the Anthropocene thinkers summoned phantasmal future geologists to relate their findings of an Earth-haunting anthropos back in time. For Rickards, the “images of humanity as an immense force, ghost from the past, and spectral voice from the future give the metaphor humans as a geological force an other-worldly, spiritual feel” reminiscent of “the teleological Judeo-Christian Garden of Eden story about humans’ struggle to remake Heaven on Earth and thus restore their position as God’s chosen ones, following their expulsion into the earthly wilderness” (2015, pp. 284–285).

The same eschatological underpinning can be found in the Manifesto. In Occidental eschatology Jacob Taubes sees a direct line between Jewish eschatological believes and Marx’ continuing of the Enlightenment tradition of mining future imaginaries from Reason. Tracing this line through Christianity, Kant, Hegel, and finally to the “philosophical eschatology” of Kirkegaard and Marx, Taubes locates in Marx’ proletariat the nineteenth century expression of “the messianic community of apocalypticism” (Taubes 2009, p. 192). Taubes enlists a well-known section of the Manifesto as evidence:

\begin{quote}
The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the labourers, due to competition, by the revolutionary combination, due to association. The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.
\end{quote}

The narratives of the Anthropocene and the Manifesto thus both come with imagined pasts culminating in the present and imagined futures where humans have either entered a classless society (the Manifesto) or disappeared completely (Jan Zalasiewicz (2008) imagines a World after Us). Two radically opposed political programs thus emerge. The first is grounded in the masses of people opposing a small elite; the second in the mass of humans constituting a geological force. The former tries to politicize the population explicitly by turning one strata against the other; the latter to naturalize antagonism implicitly by sedimenting us all into the same crust. The intended consequence of the first is revolutionary politics; the political program of the second is—well, what exactly? In the next section we turn to a critical deconstruction of Anthropocene discourse before comparing it to the discourse of eco-civilization.

\subtitle{Time out of joint}

Christophe Bonneuil and Jean-Baptiste Fressoz have set out to discover the potential political derivatives of Anthropocene discourse. Through a deconstruction of key Anthropocene texts written by geologists, climatologists, historians, environmentalists, sociologists and others, they show that scientists have “developed an authorized narrative of the Earth, its past and its future shared with the human species, a narrative that makes the management of the Earth system a new object of knowledge and government” (Bonneuil and Fressoz 2016, p. 1). In Anthropocene discourse, they locate an “excessively teleological” return to historical stages long since abandoned in the field of history (ibid., p. 5), and an environmental crisis that has turned into an “eschatological issue” in the need of “immense and majestic narratives” (ibid., p. 15) powered by a pre-history of the Anthropocene drawing a straight line from humans as hunter-gatherers to becoming a geological force (ibid., p. 14). This leaves little room for voices not ready to board this particular telos, such as “indigenous communities and other grassroots socioenvironmental movements” (ibid., p. 11). The categories employed to make sense of the Anthropocene further emerged from Cold War knowledge practices. They allow the construction of an object which is global in scope (the global average temperature, warn Bonneuil and Fressoz (ibid., p. 6), is “an abstraction that does not correspond to any particular place”), and conceptualized as a system (ibid., p. 7) or a laboratory (ibid., p. 8) to be managed. Anthropocene discourse is infused by the imagery emerging out of post-World War II attempts at bridging the Cartesian divide between humanity and nature which lead to concepts of ecosystems and cybernetics (7). The Anthropocene discourse, then, creates an instrumentalised Earth above which humans can rise as managers, giving “an intoxicating sense of total overview, global and dominating, rather than a sense of humble belonging” (ibid., p. 10).

The whole world an object, the subject of the Anthropocene becomes an undifferentiated humanity (ibid., p. 14) or a species (ibid., p. 15) at once “heroic and unsustainable” (ibid., p. 29). Reminiscent of the history of Communism, a vanguard, this time of scientists, is imagined against the backdrop of the bewildered masses (ibid., p. 22), the implicit political program becoming a technocratic one. The technocratic desire underlying Anthropocene discourse is visible already in one of the founding texts, Paul Crutzen’s Geology of mankind appearing in Nature in 2002:

\begin{quote}
Mankind will remain a major geological force for many millennia, maybe millions of years, to come. To develop a world-wide accepted strategy leading to sustainability of ecosystems against human induced stresses will be one of the great future tasks of mankind, requiring intensive research efforts and wise application of the knowledge thus acquired ... An exciting, but also difficult and daunting task likes ahead of the global research and engineering community to guide mankind towards global, sustainable, environmental management (quoted in Bonneuil and Fressoz 2016, p. 22).
\end{quote}

A specter from the future has turned towards the past and is now facing Paul Crutzen. Its eyes are staring, its mouth is open, its message to the geologist concerns the piled-up wreckage on which he stands and into which he digs. If the specter haunting Europe of the nineteenth century was that of class difference, the ghost visiting today’s world speaks not primarily of internal human affairs. But the problem with specters is that they are never quite there. Once you go looking, the bodies they appear to inhabit turn out to be quite material. The ghost prompting Hamlet to exclaim that “the time is out of joint” speaks from behind a visored armor and would likely vanish should one peek inside. The specter of class struggle too is always not there. A Foxconn suicide happens due to psychology or biography; a revolt takes place over increased food or fuel prices; an employment contract is signed in an act of free will. The specter of the Anthropocene is similarly absently present. A particular storm system is never caused by climate change; a moment of silence does not sing of species going extinct; a maneating tiger says nothing about a degraded habitat.

When our contemporary Hamlet realizes that “the time is out of joint,” his first act is to name this time “the Anthropocene” and to recount an impressive narrative of world-wide strategies for millennia to come. But the Anthropocene, with its vision for a technocratically managed global future, is not without competitors. Where, in the Euro-American world, the Anthropocene emerged from geology only to be taken up by a wider scientific community, in China the term Ecological Civilization was picked up from agricultural economics by the party-state and was only subsequently, having undergone official redevelopment, massively disseminated through the state-controlled press. Both in terms of origin, development and dissemination trajectories the Anthropocene and eco-civilization emerge from different places and follow different paths. The two concepts further provide global imaginaries rooted in very different origin stories. Where the Anthropocene discourse includes a teleological past of an emerging species not situated in any particular human culture, eco-civilization is presented as the stage where Chinese particularity assumes the position of the universal. Chinese civilization, portrayed as the only civilization of antiquity surviving down into the present, is rediscovered to carry within itself the philosophy needed for harmonic relations between humanity and nature in our new global age. Pan Yue, widely held to be the main theorizer of eco-civilization, spells it out for us:

\begin{quote}
According to Western traditional philosophy, mankind is the most valuable part of the world while nature and other forms of life are targets for our domination and therefore has no value. Therefore, morality is only designed for man and there is no need to act morally towards nature or any other forms of life. This is the philosophical basis for the concept of man ruling nature in the industrial civilization The ecological civilization, however, believes that value exists in both man and nature; nature is also endowed with the power to take the initiative; and all forms of life depend on nature, including mankind (quoted in Hansen, Li, and Svarverud 2018, p. 197)
\end{quote}

But already here, where the narratives differ the most as the Anthropocene is rooted in an apparently universal history and the eco-civilization in cultural specificity, similarities begin to appear. Whatever their thought pasts, they both claim to do the work needed for a sustainable future: traversing the Cartesian dualism supposedly at the heart of our environmental problems. And crucially, the imaginary of eco-civilization harbors the same eschatological mark as does Anthropocene discourse. It is viewed as the next, more advanced civilization of human development, one that is able to carry within itself the socialist legacy of the People’s Republic (ibid.). The official version of the socialist legacy is an explicitly teleological one. When the fifth study circle of the nineteenth politburo gathered to read the Manifesto in April 2018, Xi Jinping’s interpretation echoed that of Taubes, but with one crucial omission. With no reference to the class analysis underlying the teleological formulation, Xi in the official dispatch following the study circle still insisted that the Communist Manifesto was “a classical work showing clearly and scientifically the rules of development for human society” (一部科学洞见人类 社会发展规律的经典著作).

With a hollow modern eschatology providing the Chinese Communist Party with continued political legitimacy, elements of major religious and philosophical traditions of the East Asian mainland providing a theoretical foundation, and an optimism in the ability of science and technology to solve environmental problems, eco-civilization triangulates an imaginary of a technocratically managed future where green economic growth is powered by global infrastructural integration through the Belt and Road Initiative. Hansen et al (2018, pp. 198–199) quote an official from the Ministry of Science and Technology explaining that the technological and scientific advances accompanying industrialization have created environmental degradation “which directly threatens the survival and development of humankind.” Echoing the Anthropocene discourse, then, the eco-civilization theoreticians speak on behalf of an undifferentiated humanity facing a common enemy as they lay plans for a global future.
